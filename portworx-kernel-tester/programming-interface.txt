	The kernel test script relies can invoke different drivers
(for lack of a better term) for different distributions and, potentially,
different container systems.


Top level programs:

	./test_kernel_pkgs.sh [--distribution=dist] [--containers=container_system] [--logdir=logdir] pxfuse_src_dir pkg_file [pkg_file...]

		Based on values of distribution and container_system,
		test that the contents of pxfuse_src_dir compiles.

	./test_kernels_in_mirror.sh  [--distribution=dist] [--containers=container_system] [--logdir=logdir] pxfuse_src_dir mirror_dir

		Invokes test_kern_pkgs function, described below, to
		test all kernels in the given directory tree


	test_kernel_pkgs_log_results pxfuse_src_directory log_dir_parent log_dir_suffix pkg_file [pkg_file...]
		If $log_dir_parent/$log_dir_suffix/done exists, do nothing.
		Otherwise, invoke test_kernel_pkgs, logging output in
		build.log (in that directory).  On success, stores the
		resultant px.ko in the same directory as build.log.
		On completion (succes or failure), creates the empty
		file "done" in that directory.

	 pxfuse_src_directory
		Based on the contents of pxfuse_src_directory


Distribution interface:

	The distribution interface uses the $distribution shell global
	variable to select the distribution type.  Currently, "ubuntu",
	"debian" and "centos" are supported.  Every shell function func
	listed below is just a wrapper that invokes func_$distribution.

	dist_init_container	-  Install any needed initial
				   packages in the initial container.

	pkg_files_to_kernel_dirs - Extract the kernel directory strings
				  from the given list of kernel header
				  packages.

	pkg_files_to_names	- Given a list of package files (outside
				  of the container) output a list of the
				  package names that can be passed to
				  uninstall_pkgs

	install_pkgs_dir dir	- Install all of the .deb or .rpm files
			  	  that are located in directory dir
				  in the container

        install_pkgs		- Install packages over the network by name

	uninstall_pkgs	        - Uninstall the specified package names.

	pkgs_update		- Do something like
				  "apt-get update" or "yum update".
				  Perhaps unnecessary.

	walk_mirror dir command [args..]
				- Descend into subdirectories of a
				  mirror tree, finding the relevant
				  kernel packages and invoking
				  comand with args followed by a
				  recommended logging subdirectory,
				  followed by package files that
				  refers to a single set of kernel headers.
				  Typically command
				  and args is something like
				  "test_kernel_pkgs_log_results
				  $pxfuse_src_dir $log_dir_top".
				  This function relies on the global
				  variable $arch (which currently should
				  be "x86_64").  In the future, this
				  function might be moved to a separate
				  file related to mirror operations.

	test_kernel_pkgs_func container_tmpdir results_logdir
			       - This is the main function of
				  ./test_kernel_pkgs.  There is
				  a default version of this function,
				  test_kernel_pkgs_func.default, which
				  distribution specific drivers can
				  wrap or redirect to.  On success, it
				  copies px.ko into the directory
				  $results_logdir.


Container interface:

	The container interface uses the $container_system shell global
	variable to select the container type.  Currently "docker" is the
	only implemented driver, but "lxc" or "chroot" might come later.

	Every shell function func listed below is just a wrapper that
	invokes func_$container_system.

	The container interface is at a lower level than the distribution
	distribution driver functions.  It never directly calls such
	functions, which is why, for example, the start_container
	function takes an argument that is the function to be called
	to do the distrbitution-specific initialization of the container.

	start_containter init_command [args...]
			 	  Makes sure a container
				  is available for in_container.  Uses the
				  the $distribution shell variables to which
				  container template to use.  If a new
				  container had to be created, invoke
				  init_command [args...] to do the
				  distribution-specific initialization

	in_container shell_command - Run the shell command in the container.
		     		   standard input, standard output, standard
				   error and exit code are passed through.

	stop_container		- Takes no argument.  Shut down the container
				  if necessary.  Actually, for many
				  container systems it is pretty harmless
				  to leave this as a no-op.

Directories on host:

	/var/lib/pwx-mirror	- Contains crontab.txt
	/var/lib/pwx-mirror/build-results

	/usr/local/share/pwx-kernel-test/scripts
				- All script libraries used by pwx-kernel-test
	/usr/local/bin/pwx-update-mirrors
	/usr/local/bin/pwx-test-kernel-headers
	/usr/local/bin/pwx-test-kernel-headers-throughout-mirror
