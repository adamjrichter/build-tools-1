To install the Portworx mirror server on a pristine Ubuntu 16.04 instance,
do the following in this directory:

sudo ./install.sh


Also note that the script
portworx-mirror-server/unused/extract-suse-kernels-from-dvd-files.sh
can be used for extracting excerpts from SLES trial disc images (from
.iso files) that can be put in ~ftp/mirrors/dvd/sue.
